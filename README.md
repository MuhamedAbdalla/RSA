# RSA
Tags: Algorithms – Data structure – Math Theory

○ RSA is a big Integer mathematics operation. Also, it makes an encryption and decryption for a text using RSA algorithm that depend on big integer mathematics operation. We make a two different Implementation for multiplication FFT and Karatsuba algorithm. Also, we pass all test and the big test acts in less than 30 second which so fast. We achieve 4th best and fast project in algorithm course.
